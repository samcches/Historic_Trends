How is the stock market really doing?

This short analysis views the general trends of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1915, and the S&P 500 since 1927. Once the trend was removed from the decomposed data, we see that despite the numerous crashes over the past eighty to one hundred years, the markets have continued to grow. Though we are entering a new bear market, we shall rebound and see future growth, as long as we take a long-view and stomach the current fall. Do not let your animal spirits get the better of you.
